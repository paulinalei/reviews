Hi, I'm Paulina.

This site is for me to review random things. I got into reviewing after writing Yelp reviews for food, so I thought setting up a Jekyll blog would be a good medium to write reviews as well as give me experience in coding. I will be reviewing almost anything except food. If you are interested in reading those, the link for my Yelp profile is [here](https://paulinalei.yelp.com).
